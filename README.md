### Hi, I'm Keez 👋

Software Engineer at [Medworld](https://www.medworld.com/), formerly Software Engineer at [Fingermark](https://www.fingermark.tech/)

I thoroughly enjoy browsing open source projects and hope to contribute more often 😅

Im interested in Machine Learning and AI 🧠, Algorithm Visualization🧩, and am facinated with the [parallels between Biology and Computer Science 🦠](https://github.com/geohot/corona#biology-vs-software). I also spend a lot of time with [React](https://reactjs.org/)  ⚛️ and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) 👨‍💻 at work.

Outside of tech, I enjoy powerlifting 🏋️  and anime 👺 / manga 📖.

If you have any questions or want to get in touch please use the email address listen in my [Github bio](https://github.com/keezeden)
