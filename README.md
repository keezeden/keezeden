### Hi, I'm Keez 👋

Software Engineer at [Medworld](), formerly Software Engineer at [Fingermark]()

I thoroughly enjoy browsing open source projects and hope to contribute more often 😅

Im interested in ML/AI 🧠, Algorithm Visualization🧩, and am facinated with the [parallels between Biology and Computer Science. 🦠](https://github.com/geohot/corona#biology-vs-software) I also spend a lot of time with [React](https://reactjs.org/) ⚛️ and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)👨‍💻 at work.

Outside of tech, I enjoy powerlifting 🏋️ and anime 👺 / manga 📖.

If you have any questions or want to get in touch please use the email address listen in my [Github bio](https://github.com/keezeden)
